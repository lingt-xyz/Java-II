// This program illustrates how "protected" access rights 
// are influenced by different packages. 
//
// A derived class has generally access to the protected
// attributes of its base class, however, the following is true 
// if the classes belong to different packages:
// A derived class that belongs to a different package cannot 
// access the protected attributes of its base class through
// objects of that base class. Derived classes however have the
// right to create objects of their own class and access the protected
// attributes of the base class through these objects. 
// 
// See the showInfo()method below. 
//
// Key Points: 
// 	1) Protected access rights and packages
// *******************************************************************
// These classes are created in a different package than the Vehicle package
