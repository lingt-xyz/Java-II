// This program introduction "binary" files. Binary files
// store data in a format that is understood by the computer
// memory, rather by a human being. Text files, which can be 
// read by a human being need to be transformed first into binary
// format for computers to understand them. So, in cases where there
// is no need to access/read a file using a text editor, it is much 
// more efficient to directly write your data into binary files instead. 
// Beside saving the transformation time, binary files are also portable; 
// that is, they can be moved from any computer to another and still be 
// successfully read by Java (but only by Java) on that machine.
// 
// Key Points:
// 1) Binary Files.
// 2) Writing to Binary Files Using the ObjectOutputStream Class.
